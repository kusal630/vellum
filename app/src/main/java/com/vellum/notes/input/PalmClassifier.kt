/**
 * Pure per-contact classifier. Given a [NormalizedContact] and a [ClassifyContext] it
 * returns a classification. All decisions derive from real information the OS exposes;
 * hardware stylus signals are trusted only when actually present (tool type == STYLUS /
 * ERASER).
 *
 * Design rules:
 *  - A real stylus tool type is always accepted as writing; a real eraser is always an
 *    eraser. These hardware signals cannot be a palm.
 *  - **Multi-pointer**: when several pointers are active simultaneously, classification
 *    is done RELATIVELY. Raw contact-size values are not calibrated to real-world units
 *    and vary wildly across digitizers and densities, so a fixed absolute size can mean
 *    "pen" on one tablet and "palm" on another. Instead the contact is compared to the
 *    smallest active contact in the SAME frame: a contact that is at least
 *    [PALM_RATIO_VS_SMALLEST] times larger than the smallest active contact is a palm;
 *    anything else is pen/finger input. Because the comparison is relative it adapts to
 *    any hardware with no per-device calibration.
 *  - **Single-pointer fallback**: with only one contact there is nothing to compare
 *    against, so the classifier falls back to an adaptive, self-calibrating rule. It
 *    keeps a short rolling history of contact sizes confirmed as small (valid) and
 *    large (palm) — confirmed only at moments when a relative comparison was actually
 *    possible — and judges a lone new contact against that device's OWN observed range.
 *    On cold start (no history yet) the only sane option is the user-configurable
 *    settings thresholds as a generous default until the first simultaneous-pointer
 *    comparison teaches the classifier this device's real scale.
 *  - In WRITING mode a locked writing pointer is always accepted, and every secondary
 *    contact while the lock is active is treated as a palm unless it is finger-sized
 *    (a second finger starting a two-finger gesture).

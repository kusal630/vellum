 * Which hand the user writes with. Drives handedness-aware palm rejection:
 *
 * - The resting palm anchors on the palm-side screen edge, so that edge keeps
 *   the full [PalmRejectionSettings.edgeMarginMm] as resting evidence.
 * - The opposite (writing-side) edge gets a reduced margin: a contact resting
 *   there is far less likely to be the anchored palm and far more likely the
 *   start of a two-finger gesture or the writing hand crossing over, so it
 *   must not count as edge-resting as eagerly.
 * - Top/bottom edges are symmetric under every posture (the palm heel sits
 *   near the bottom edge regardless of handedness).
 * - [TWO_HANDED] (two thumbs / either hand) applies no bias: both vertical
 *   edges keep the full margin.

/**
 * The palm rest zone: a user-reserved region of the screen where they can rest their
 * palm. Instead of (only) classifying contacts by size, any contact whose center lands
 * inside the zone is unconditionally treated as a palm — it can never write, never start
 * a two-finger gesture, and never drop the writing lock. This gives the palm a reliable
 * home and makes palm rejection predictable on any hardware.
 *
 * The zone is only active in MANUAL mode, where it is drawn as a box the user can drag.
 * In AUTO mode there is no box: palm rejection is purely automatic and contact-size
 * based (anything larger than a finger is the palm and does nothing), which keeps the
 * writing pointer from ever being blocked by a phantom area. The zone is stored in a
 * screen-relative way so it adapts to rotation and window size.
